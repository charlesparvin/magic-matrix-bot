# â€œMagicMatrix" Bot

MagicMatrix is a bot built with NodeJS for the [Matrix](http://www.matrix.org) chat system based on [hello-matrix-bot](https://gitlab.com/argit/hello-matrix-bot/)

# Bot Features

As usual, `!help` will display all relevant commands within your Matrix channel.


## Card features

Display cards in the chatroom (this is based on the mtg.io SDK, I'll change it to use Scryfall's API soon)
```
!card Black Lotus
```
Cards get cached in the localstorage folder. If there is a problem with a cached card you can clear it with `!clear cache`

## Stat-tracking features

You can log your Quick Constructed runs with the following commands, to keep track of how much gold you won or lost or your average/median number of wins

```
!qc             View your current stats
!qc add <X>     Add a run with X wins
!qc undo        Remove last run saved
```

And in a similar way, your draft runs :

```
!qd             View your current stats
!qd add <X>     Add a run with X wins
!qd undo        Remove last run saved
```
